# Vowels Count Algorithm

## Problem Statement
Given a string, count the number of vowels it contains. Vowels are the characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

## Algorithm to solve it
1. Declare a count variable to register each appearance of a vowels in the input.
2. Create an array with the expected chars to be found
3. Loop each character in the input string
4. If the character is found in the array, increment the count
5. Return the count

## Implementations
