# Algorithm Knowledge Tracker

As part of my ongoing study of algorithms, I created this project to document and organize my understanding of key concepts, implementations, and optimizations. The repository serves as a personal reference, but I hope it can also be useful to others learning algorithms and data structures.

## Definition
An algorithm is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to do something, or you can also say it is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and programming, as they provide the logic and structure needed to perform computations and process data efficiently.
