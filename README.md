# Algorithm Knowledge Tracker

As part of my ongoing study of algorithms, I created this project to document and organize my understanding of key concepts, implementations, and optimizations. The repository serves as a personal reference, but I hope it can also be useful to others learning algorithms and data structures.

Tech Stack:

TypeScript (for clear, type-safe implementations and readability)

Go (for performance-critical implementations and concurrency exploration)
