# Factorial

## Description
The factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). It is denoted by \( n! \) and is defined as follows:
- \( n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 1 \)
- \( 0! = 1 \) (by definition)
- \( 1! = 1 \)

## Examples
- \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( 0! = 1 \)
