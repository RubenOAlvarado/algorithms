# Average

## Description
The average (or mean) of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers. It is a measure of central tendency that provides a single value representing the center of a data set.

## Formula
The average is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}} \]

Where:
- Sum of all values is the total of all numbers in the set.
- Number of values is the count of numbers in the set.  

## Examples
- Average of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 3
- Average of [10, 20, 30] = (10 + 20 + 30) / 3 = 20
