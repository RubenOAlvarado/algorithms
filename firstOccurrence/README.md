# First Occurrence of a Character in a String

## Problem Statement
Given a string and a character, find the index of the first occurrence of the character in the string. If the character is not found, return -1.

## Algorithm
1. Iterate through the string using a loop.
2. For each character in the string, check if it matches the given character.
3. If a match is found, return the index of that character.
4. If the loop completes without finding a match, return -1.

## Implementation
- [TypeScript](./ts)
